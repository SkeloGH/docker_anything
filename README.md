# Docker anything

## What?

Imagine a series of services that need to communicate between them, this tool aims to ease the orchestration of creating, running and removing docker containers, without the need of having to edit the docker-compose file.

## Why?

I don't really need this tool, but I just want to get to know better docker and tinker around it.

## Where should I start?

- install and run docker
- clone this repo
- run ./setup.sh up

`setup.sh` is, therefore, a good starting point.
